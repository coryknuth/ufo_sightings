# The Truth is Out There

This project consists of a webpage which gives access to a dataset of UFO sightings. The original webpage design only allowed for filtering results by date. For the challenge portion of the project we added search functionality to the page allowing results to also be filtered by other data categories including things like the location of the sighting, and the shape of the unidentified object.

## Website Function

The website search functions are very simple to use. When the page initially loads, the entire dataset is visible in the table. In order to filter the search by any one criteria you simply need to enter your search term into the corresponding search box. The results will instantly be filtered and the table updated as shown below with this search for sightings in the state of California.

You can also easily filter by multiple search criteria by simply adding additional search terms to other search boxes. The search shown here below demonstrates that.

## Steps Forward

One key drawback of this current website design i see is the clunkiness of search term entry, as there's no way to confirm your search other than selecting another field outside the box it makes the general experience of entering search terms, particularly multiple terms, feel quite clunky, and unpolished. I would redesign the search UI to have better functionality, and to feel more polished and modern. 

I would also consider as an improvement, adding a reset search button which would clear all fields of your search. Currently the only way to do that is to manually delete search terms from each box which only adds to the gerneal feeling of clunkiness that the search box has.
