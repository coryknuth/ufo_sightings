# The Truth is Out There

This project consists of a webpage which gives access to a dataset of UFO sightings. The original webpage design only allowed for filtering results by date. For the challenge portion of the project we added search functionality to the page allowing results to also be filtered by other data categories including things like the location of the sighting, and the shape of the unidentified object.

## Website Function

The website search functions are very simple to use. When the page initially loads, the entire dataset is visible in the table. In order to filter the search by any one criteria you simply need to enter your search term into the corresponding search box. The results will instantly be filtered and the table updated as shown below with this search for sightings in the state of California.

You can also easily filter by multiple search criteria by simply adding additional search terms to other search boxes. The search shown here below demonstrates that.
